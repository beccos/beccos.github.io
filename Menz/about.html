<h3>About Menz Refrigerated Transport</h3>

<p>Trucking is in the blood for some and coming from a trucking family David Menz was destined to follow in his father's footsteps when he started Menz Refrigerated Transport back in 1989. <br>&#34;Working in transport is just what I always wanted to do&#34; - David Menz</p>

<p>David and his wife Maree have worked hard for the past 26 years with the business growing through reputation and word of mouth from their 200 plus satisfied customers. Their focus began with providing refrigerated transport for the organic produce and smallgoods sectors but has now grown to include most refrigerated and ambient products. Some of their current customers include Primo Smallgoods, Eco Farms, Freshzest, United Organics, Bidvest, PFD, Golden Cockrell, Spar Supermarkets and IGA Supermarkets.
Menz Refrigerated Transport is a true family business with several of David and Maree&#39;s children joining them and their current staff of twenty in the daily running of the business.</p>
<p>The past seven years has seen their fleet of trucks grow from five to fourteen with an average age of less than five years and a capability of taking loads from a couple of cartons up to 22 pallets in size.
