<h3>About Menz Refridgerated Transport</h3>

<p>Trucking is in the blood for some and coming from a trucking family David Menz was destined to follow in his father&#39;s footsteps when he started Menz Refrigerated Transport back in 1989. &#34;	Working in transport is just what I always wanted to do&#34;	 he says.
We cover South East Queensland and travel from Brisbane to areas like Lennox Heads and Byron Bay servicing the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales.</p>

<p>David Menz has worked hard for the last 23 years and his business has grown through reputation and word of mouth. Menz Transport is seriously bucking trends and proving that reliability and service are the foundations of a sound business model.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve got about 100 clients and we mainly carry refrigerated small goods and organic produce. We have two major clients, Primo Small Goods and Eco Farms, and service shopping centres including Spar convenience stores.</p>

<p>David Menz says business has been very good because of the consistent work and for the 13 staff there is never  a dull moment as the business has expanded, like the loads it carries, organically.</p>

<p>Menzâ€™s Refrigerated Transport is a true family business and David attributes the success of the business to a family focus, with wife Maree working as the administration manager, and three of their five children active in the business. And the help of all his drivers and his manager Dean Weir, who has been with him from the start.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve gone from five trucks to nine in the last two years, he says. When we find we are getting too busy we buy one more truck to carry the load.</p>
